# Automated_decision-making_system_of_scheduling

Introduction
This project was completed as part of the MATH380 course at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Kunwoo Lee and under the guidance of Professor Hemanshu Kaul. The registrar's office is responsible for scheduling classes and tests each semester, a task that involves selecting appropriate times and venues for each course to avoid scheduling conflicts. While this may seem straightforward, the intricacies reveal the complexity of the responsibility.

In this project, we aimed to develop an automated decision-making system to alleviate the challenges of course scheduling. Utilizing a mathematical model and solver, our system generates solutions that meet the needs of departments, faculty, and students alike. By streamlining the scheduling process, this technology significantly reduces the time required to organize classes and exams. Moreover, it ensures that students have access to the courses they need while allowing instructors to effectively manage their classrooms.
